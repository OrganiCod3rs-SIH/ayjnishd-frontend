This repository ultimately focuses on recreating the [ADIP Cochlear Implant Site](http://adipcochlearimplant.in/) for Smart India Hackathon. From improving the site's UI/UX to adding additional features, our ultimate plan is to make the site more accessible to end users in terms of easiness and functionality.

## Tech-Stack:
 
- Languages:
  1. JavaScript
  2. HTML
  
- Frameworks and Database:
  1. ExpressJS
  2. PostgreSQL
  3. NextJS
  4. React

## Basic approach:

Our first and foremost approach is to improve the UX of the navigaton bar. In a nutshell, we plan on integrating different routes which are added as tabs to the _navigation bar_. This _navigation bar_ can then be used to go to different pages within the website. We believe that this will help users to get all the "go-to" paths at one place which will highly increase user-time-efficiency while navigating through the website.


A user can scroll through the website and interact with different contents:
- Apply for the scheme.
- Check application status.
- Go through the FAQ.
- Learn about the product and much more.

_More to be worked on soon!_
