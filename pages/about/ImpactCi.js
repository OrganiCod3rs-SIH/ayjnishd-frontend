            <p>
              Hearing impairment has a significant impact on the child and his
              family. This impact is seen on every aspect of life including
              cognitive, communication, psychosocial, educational, and
              personality development as well as on financial condition of the
              family. Considering the wide ranging impact of hearing impairment
              early identification and intervention during the critical learning
              years, has been found to be very important to minimize the impact
              of the hearing impairment in the child’s over all development.

              With the recent advances in hearing technology including cochlear
              implants, children with severe to profound hearing loss have
              access to most of the sound of spoken language. Most of children
              who are born deaf of hard of hearing can learn to listen to their
              own voices, listen to the voices of others and listen to the
              sounds of life.

              It is important to know about impact of cochlear implants in young
              children as it involves high cost, surgery, and a high level of
              family expectations. Factors including age at onset of deafness,
              age at implantation, amount of cochlear implant experience, and
              educational training determine the overall benefits a child will
              have post cochlear implantation. Following sections will highlight
              the various impacts on the children’s lives post implantation of
              cochlear implants.

            <h3>Auditory skills</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Children with cochlear implants achieve performance levels that
              exceeded those of their non-implanted peers who used other sensory
              aids, including conventional hearing aids and vibrotactile aids.2
              The improvement of hearing in terms of purely audiological
              performance is remarkable: audiological tests including
              monosyllabic word and sentences tests show a noticeable increase
              in open word recognition after implantation of cochlear implants3.
              The improved auditory skills enhance the opportunity for
              acquisition of speech and language.
